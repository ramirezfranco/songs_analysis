# songs_analysis

In this repository you can find my work related to the analysis of songs lyrics. To date I have two works: 
1. Identifying misogyny and violence in reggaeton music. 
  ##### Notebooks:
    a. ragaetton_corpus.ipynb: An example of how to create a corpus from a list of artists using Genius API.
    b. similarities_w2v.ipynb: Here I present an example of a comparison of similarities of words produced by different word embeddings.
    c. regaetton_ners.ipynb: Finding Name Entities in corpora using the Standford CoreNLP toolkit
  ##### Code:
    a. util.py: Utility functions used during the different stages of the analysis. Documentation in progress.
2. Topic Modeling of lyrics.
  In progress
